              story, Ging Freecss abandoned his son <strong id="gon_"> Gon</strong>
              and left him in the care
              of his cousin Mito on Whale Island. As Gon grows up, he discovers
              that his father (who was supposedly dead) had abandoned him to
              become one of the best Hunters. Motivated by this, <strong
                id="gon_"> Gon</strong> decides to
              leave his home and apply for the Hunter Exam, which consists of
              overcoming a series of challenges that seek to test the skills,
              survival, and teamwork of its participants.

              During the exam, <strong id="gon_">Gon</strong> meets and
              befriends three other participants:
              <strong id="kurapika_">Kurapika</strong>, the last member of the
              Kurta Clan, who wishes to become
              a Hunter in order to avenge his family and recover the scarlet
              eyes that were stolen from their bodies by a group of mercenaries
              called Gen’ei Ryodan; <strong id="leorio_">Leorio</strong>, who
              just wants to be a Hunter so he
              can pay for his medical studies; and <strong id="killua_">Killua</strong>,
              a young man who left
              his previous life as a member of the most famous family of
              assassins. Thus, <strong id="gon_">Gon</strong> in the company of
              his friends will live a
              series of adventures while each tries to fulfill their wish.</p>
