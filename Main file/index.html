                the
                story, Ging Freecss abandoned his son <strong id="gon_"> Gon</strong>
                and left him in the care
                of his cousin Mito on Whale Island. As Gon grows up, he
                discovers
                that his father (who was supposedly dead) had abandoned him to
                become one of the best Hunters. Motivated by this, <strong

                leave his home and apply for the Hunter Exam, which consists of
                overcoming a series of challenges that seek to test the skills,
                survival, and teamwork of its participants.

                During the exam, <strong id="gon_">Gon</strong> meets and
                befriends three other participants:
                <strong id="kurapika_">Kurapika</strong>, the last member of the
                Kurta Clan, who wishes to become
                a Hunter in order to avenge his family and recover the scarlet
                eyes that were stolen from their bodies by a group of
                mercenaries
                called Gen’ei Ryodan; <strong id="leorio_">Leorio</strong>, who
                just wants to be a Hunter so he

                a young man who left
                his previous life as a member of the most famous family of

                  Azian Continent. There are 250 countries in the world.

                own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them
                whether they know it or not. There are four basic Nen
                techniques; Ten maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it
                for defense, Zetsu shuts the aura flow off, useful for
                concealing one's presence and relieving fatigue, Ren enables a
                user to produce more Nen, and Hatsu is a person's specific use
                of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on
                their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers strengthen and reinforce their
                natural physical abilities, Emitters project aura out of their
                bodies,Manipulators control objects or living things,
                Transmuters change the type or properties of their aura,
                Conjurers create objects out of their aura, and Specialists have
                unique abilities that do not fall into the previous
                categories. A Nen user can enter into a Contract whereby
                pledging to follow certain Limitations, their abilities are
                strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of
                this is Kurapika who, in order to have an unbreakable chain that
                will hold members of the Phantom Troupe no matter what, offered
